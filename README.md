intigriti-slack-announce
========================
Go bot that publishes (non-sensitive) new intigriti findings to Slack.

## Setup
1. Download [the latest isa release](https://github.com/hazcod/intigriti-slack-announce/releases).
2. Create a Slack app, create a [Slack incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#getting_started) and add `chat:write` permissions.
3. Retrieve your [intigriti API token](https://intigriti.com/) and pass your (external) IP address for whitelisting.
4. Create your configuration file:
```yaml
# skip findings in triage, archived and closed
include_non_ready: false

# how often to check in minutes
check_interval_minutes: 15

# your slack webhook
slack_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# your intigriti API credentials
intigriti_client_id: "XXXXXXXXXXX"
intigriti_client_secret: "XXXXXXXXXXX"
```
5. Run `isa` (preferably as a service) with arguments:
```shell
./isa -conf=my-conf.yaml
```
3. See new intigriti findings roll in on your Slack channel.
Any findings already sent to your Slack channel will be added to your YAML configuration file for portability.

## Building
This requires `make` and `go` to be installed.
Just run `make`.
